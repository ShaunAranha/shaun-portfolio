Growing up, I was always fascinated with technology and aesthetic design, be it through video games, my interest in fashion,
or my interest in sports and the analytics behind it. I began to pursue my interests by pursuing my Bachelor's of Science at
the University of Toronto Mississauga for Computer Science and Communications. This let me learn about what it took to develop
applications with good programming practices and also what constituted good design as well. I was also blessed enough to work 
as a co-op student in the government sector, and that provided me with insight as to what are good industry practices for software 
engineering.

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in the software engineering space.
